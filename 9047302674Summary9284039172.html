										<p>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood and has been often linked to poorer life outcomes such as lower educational achievement and premature death. These outcomes have been attributed to higher levels of risk-taking behaviour in individuals with ADHD. The present study used a quasi-experimental research design to investigate risk-taking and decision- making deficits in diagnosed ADHD, undiagnosed ADHD, and control groups, encompassing a total of 86 participants aged 18 to 52 years. The study aimed to disentangle risk-seeking from suboptimal choices to investigate if decision-making deficits in ADHD are related to suboptimal decision making or risk seeking on a probabilistic gambling task. The study found partial support for the hypothesis that decision-making deficits in ADHD are related to risk- seeking, with the undiagnosed ADHD group making significantly more suboptimal risky choices than controls only when risk was disadvantageous. However, no significant differences were observed between the diagnosed ADHD and control groups. Additionally, no significant between-group differences were found for cognitive ability. The inclusion of undiagnosed symptomatic individuals provided valuable insights into the potential role of ADHD symptom heterogeneity and treatment on decision-making deficits and risk-taking behaviour. The study's findings highlight the importance of further research into the relationships between ADHD medication use, and task-related complexity in decision- making paradigms to enhance understanding and aid the development of new interventions.</p>
